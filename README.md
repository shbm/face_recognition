# face-recognition

A face recognition model trained on the faces of my batchmates in a classroom setting. Also, includes a Flask API wrapped around the model. I wrote this in my Junior year of Bacherlors Degree. This produces a model small enough to run on a cheap R-pi with a camera module. The pretrained weights come from David Sandberg's training on GPU for multiple days.
